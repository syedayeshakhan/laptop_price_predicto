# Laptop Price Predictor

This machine learning project predicts laptop prices using regression techniques. It involves extensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) for insights. Various machine learning and deep learning models were tested, with Random Forest selected as the final model.

### Installations:
 
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the Jupyter notebook: Laptop Price Predictor.ipynb
## File Description:
